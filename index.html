        Hello! Thank you everyone for visiting my page. My name is Jonathan Staib and I am currently a 201 student at Code Fellows! I got my High School Diploma at Harborfields High School in Long Island, NY. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My most recent occupation was as a receptionist at a Physcial Therapy office. It was very quiet except when dealing with insurance companies. I have also worked in the restaurant business at two seperate locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Goals that I have are completing/gradutating Code Fellows with a level of understanding that I can jump into the field right away. I enjoy coding very much even though it can be very difficult at times. I am not a fan of CSS if I'm going to be honest. I would like to pursue a career in coding and make a great living off of it. You can't complain about enjoying your job and having good pay, you know? 
      </p>

        This summarizes up my somewhat short biography, thank you very much for stopping by my page! I hope to see you again soon.
